Books and papers to read to get into AI without prior experience :)

# Introduction
That's it, what to read, in no special order, I will give a hint on which are great books if you are getting started, or if you need more advanced knowledge; based mainly on the amount of maths and intricate details that you need to get the most from the book.

This reading list covers books that have been read; many of them have been recommendations by others, many others gems that were discovered from the Internet.

Choose the sections depending on the generality that you are looking for; if you read all of them, you will be ahead on AI.
